                        <p class="card-text">Therefore, we believe that transparency and convenience is a priority when users are donating or volunteering and that we might be able to help if we create a streamlined donation/volunteering process through the organizations website. We might do this by reorganizing the navigation and reprioritizing the homepage to emphasize the organizations mission and ways users can help. Doing this will allow our product to increase the number of returning donors and remove the frustration that comes with giving back so users can focus on what they enjoy about helping.</p>
